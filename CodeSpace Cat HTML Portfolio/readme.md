# Project Overview
A short description of my project.

My project is about the CodeSpace Cat's Portfolio, which tells us about CodeSpace Cat, that he is purr-ssionate about web development and the Portfolio it also tells us the skills he has around software engineering and his life.
Then it details the CodeSpace Cat - Catfolio projects he has coded or done so far, and it he has listed the name, dates, description and thumbnail of the projects listed.
At the end there is a form, which contains name, email, and message inputs where you can find or reach out at CodeSpace Cat, to talk about his portfolio and the projects he has done that are in the portfolio.
At the bottom of the page there is a copyright of CodeSpace Cat and that all the rights of everything in the portfolio has been reserved.
